 <h1>Battleground states lead the way, as the United States breaks records for voter turnout in the 2020 Presidential Election</h1>
 <p>By Pat Elliott Dec 18, 2020</p>

<figcaption>All 50 states saw a rise in turnout from the previous presidential contest </figcaption>

  <p>While some in the United States (including the current President) continue to challenge the results of the 2020 election, one thing beyond dispute is that it produced levels of voter turnout that United States has never seen before. Over 158 million American voted, either by mail, absentee, or showing up at the polls on November 3. The overall turnout rate rose almost 7 percentage points from 59.22% to 66.14%</p>
  <p>Among the states that led the way in turnout many also had the closest margins between the incumbent, Donald J. Trump and the challenger, former Vice President (and now President-Elect) Joe Biden. </p>

  </script>

  <p>Notable states that stood out for high voter turnout include the “rust-belt” states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan, which all landed in the top 10. Michigan and Wisconsin were top priorities for the Biden campaign, as traditional blue states that Hillary Clinton lost in 2016 by narrow margins.  </p>

</script>

  <p>Also of note were states with highly contested senate races. Maine (2nd), Colorado (3rd), Montana (12th), and North Carolina (15th) all had tight senate races that received heavy amounts of national attention in the lead up to November 3. Each were well above the national average on voter turnout. </p>
