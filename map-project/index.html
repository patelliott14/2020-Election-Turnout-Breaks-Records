 <h1>Battleground states lead the way, as the United States breaks records for voter turnout in the 2020 Presidential Election</h1>
 <p>By Pat Elliott Dec 18, 2020</p>

<figcaption>All 50 states saw a rise in turnout from the previous presidential contest </figcaption>

  <p>While some in the United States (including the current President) continue to dispute the results of the election, one thing beyond dispute, is that the 2020 produced levels of voter turnout that United States has never seen before. Over 158 million Americans voted either by mail, absentee or showed up at the polls on November 3. The overall turnout rate rose almost 7 percentage points from 59.22% to 66.14%. </p>
  <p>Among the states that led the way in turnout, many also had the closest margins between the incumbent, President Donald J. Trump and the challenger, former Vice President, and now President-Elect Joe Biden.</p>

  </script>

  <p>Notable states that stood out for high voter turnout included the “rust-belt” which includes Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan, all of whom landed in the top 10. Michigan and Wisconsin were of top priority for the Biden campaign, as they were traditional blue states that Hillary Clinton lost in 2016. </p>

</script>

  <p>Also of note were states with highly contested senate races. Maine (2nd), Colorado (3rd), Montana(12th) and North Carolina (15th) all had tight senate races that received heavy amounts of national attention in the lead up to November 3.</p>
